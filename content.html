    <h3><strong> Humans Impacts On The Environment</strong></h3>
    <p>Humans impact the physical environment in many ways: overpopulation, pollution, burning fossil fuels, and deforestation. Changes like these have triggered climate change, soil erosion, poor air quality, and undrinkable water. These negative impacts can affect human behavior and can prompt mass migrations or battles over clean water.
    Urbanization, lack of contact with the natural world, and growing up removed from agriculture has contributed to a void of knowledge relating to food and food production, along with a phenomenon known as plant blindness.The exploitation of ecosystems by humans has long-lasting consequences for the future provision of natural resources and ecosystem services.</p>
    <p>We as humans have become dependent on luxuries such as cars, houses, and even our cell phones. But what does our love for manufactured metallic and plastic goods do to the environment? Things like overconsumption, overfishing, deforestation are dramatically impacting our world. 
        Human activity can be directly attributed to the cause of hundreds of extinctions in the last two centuries, versus the millions of years that extinctions naturally occur. As we progress through the 21st century, humans have changed the world in unprecedented ways.
        Human impact on the environment has become one of the main topics for university staff all over the world. While they search for the answer, the public needs to do its part. At least, you need to be aware of all the factors that contribute to this state and share the knowledge.

    <ol>
         <li><p><b>Overpopulation</b></p></li><br>
         <img src="/over population.jpg" alt="image" height="200" width="500">
         <p>Survival used to mean repopulating. That, however, is quickly becoming true for the opposite as we reach the maximum carrying capacity that our planet can sustain.Overpopulation has grown into an epidemic since mortality rates have decreased, medicine has improved, and methods of industrial farming were introduced, thus keeping humans alive for much longer and increasing the total population.
         The effects of overpopulation are quite severe, with one of the most severe being the degradation of the environment.

         Humans require space and lots of it whether it is for farmland or industries which also takes up tons of space. An increased population results in more clear-cutting, resulting in severely damaged ecosystems. Without enough trees to filter the air, CO₂ levels increase which carries the potential to damage every single organism on Earth.
         
         Another issue is our dependency on coal and fossil fuels for energy, the larger the population, the more fossil fuels will be used. The use of fossil fuels (such as oil and coal) results in copious amounts of carbon dioxide into the air- threatening the extinction of thousands of species which adds to the effect that forest depletion already has.
         
         Humanity continuously requires more space, which devastates ecosystems and increases CO₂ levels, further devastating the delicate environment. Although processed materials are necessary to power the cities, the previous assessment tells us that the planet can only sustain so much damage until it will begin to damage us.</p><br>
        <li><b>Pollution</b></li><br>
        <img src="/pollution.jpg" alt="image" height="200" width="500">
         <p>Pollution is everywhere. From the trash thrown out on the freeway, to the millions of metric tons of pollution pumped into the atmosphere every year- it's obvious, pollution and waste are inescapable. 

            Pollution is so bad that to date, 2.4 billion people do not have access to clean water sources. Humanity is continuously polluting indispensable resources like air, water, and soil which requires millions of years to replenish.
            
            Air is arguably the most polluted with the US producing 147 million metric tons of air pollution each year alone.
            
            In 1950, smog was so bad in LA that the ground-level ozone (atmospheric gas that is great in the atmosphere, not so much on the ground) surpassed 500 parts per billion volume (ppbv)- well above the National Ambient Air Quality Standard of 75 ppbv (6.6 times more to be precise).
            
            People thought they were under foreign attack as the smog burned their eyes and left an odor of bleach in the air. That is when the devastating effect of aerosols was discovered.
            
            While air quality in the US has slightly improved, the quality in developing countries continues to plummet as smog continuously blocks out the sun in a dense shroud of pollution. This is just one of the issues we have to tackle in the near future.</p><br>
            <li><p><b>Global Warming</b></p></li><br>
            <img src="/global warming.jpg" alt="image" height="200" width="500">
            <p>Global warming is arguably the greatest cause of impact on the environment. The largest of causes emanating through CO₂ levels from respiration to more detrimental causes like burning fossil fuels and deforestation.

                At any rate, humans are consistently increasing CO₂ levels globally- every year. The highest level of CO₂ in recorded history before 1950 was about 300 parts per million. However, current measurements of CO₂ levels have exceeded above 400 PPM, abolishing every record dating back 400,000 years.
                
                The increase of CO₂ emissions has contributed to the planet's average temperature increasing almost a whole degree.
                
                As the temperature increases, arctic land ice and glaciers melt which causes the ocean levels to rise at a rate of 3.42mm per year, allowing more water to absorb more heat, which melts more ice, creating a positive feedback loop which will cause the oceans to rise 1-4 feet by 2100</p><br>
                <li><p><b>Climate Change</b></p></li><br> 
                <img src="/climate change.jpg"  alt="image" height="200" width="500">
                <p>Climate change is closely connected to the historical development of industry and technology. As global temperatures increase, Earth's weather patterns will drastically change. While some areas will experience longer growing seasons, others will become barren wastelands as water will deplete in vast areas, turning once floral regions into deserts.

                    The increase will impact weather patterns, promising more intense hurricanes in both size and frequency, as well as intensifying and prolonging droughts and heatwaves. But air pollution does not just affect the environment.
                    
                    The evidence is mounting that poor air quality and rising temperatures are ruining delicate ecosystems, even leading to increased asthma and cancer rates in humans.</p><br>
                    <li><p><b>Deforestation </b></p></li><br> 
                <img src="/Deforestation.jpg"  alt="image" height="200" width="500">
                <p>With an exponential expansion in human beings, more food, materials, and shelter are being manufactured at stupendous rates, mostly stemming from forestry.

                    Forests are cleared to make way for new humans, which in turn, makes more humans, you can see the problem. According to international data, an estimated 18 million acres of trees are clear-cut each year to make way for new development and wood products- that is just under half of all the trees on the planet since the industrial revolution began.
                    
                    With trees being one of the largest producers of oxygen, clearly that is not a good thing for humans- and especially not for the animals that call the forest home.
                    
                    With millions of different species that live in forests, deforestation is a major threat to their survival and a big conservation issue. It also increases greenhouse gases within the atmosphere which leads to further global warming. Such human activities need to stop if we wish to survive. Even more so, recent studies have attributed deforestation to the increase of wildfires in areas like Amazon. Wildfires are equally destructed even more so, displacing both people and entire species. </p><br>
